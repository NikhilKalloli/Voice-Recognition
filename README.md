# Voice Recognition 

This project aims to develop a voice recognition system using machine learning techniques. The system is built using TensorFlow and Streamlit for deployment.

## Features

- Upload two MP3 files to compare if they are from the same person.
- Display the conclusion based on the comparison: "Same person" or "Different people".

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/NikhilKalloli/Voice-Recognition.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the directory:
    ```
    cd Voice-Recognition
    ```

3. Create a Virtual Environment with python version 3.8
    ```
    py -3.8 -m venv venv
    ```
#### If you don't have python 3.8 installed, you can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-380/)

4. Install the required dependencies(in a virtual Environment):
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. Run the Streamlit app:
    ``` 
    streamlit run streamlit_app.py
    ```
